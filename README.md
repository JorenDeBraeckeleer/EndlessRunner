# EndlessRunner
In my free time I made this little endless runner with Unreal Engine 4.

You earn points by surviving and shooting asteroids. Power-ups will challenge you on your journey through space!

Can you survive the longest?

## Subjects
### Game World
Spawning of terrain, obstacles, power-ups with managers.

Environment moves towards the player.

Player moves left and right and shoots bullets.

### Shader
Curved shader to have the impression of flight to orbit.
